# Motif-Routing-Networks
Motif Routing Networks (MRNs) are neural systems that process and relay temporal patterns using wavelet-encoded motifs, enabling compositional logic, dynamic routing, and causally-traceable reward-driven learning.

## Dynamic Motif Networks

This repository contains a scaffold for experimenting with Dynamic Motif Networks (DMN). The framework mixes spiking neurons, motif detection via a simple 3D-DWT, and reinforcement learning utilities. Example experiments and unit tests are provided.
